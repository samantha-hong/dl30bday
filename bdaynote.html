            <p>Happy birthday to the best friend I could ever have ♡ Our friendship started as a text from a random number and has blossomed into what it is today! Our twenties were filled with fun adventures from going to every fusion competition to cooking and baking for all our friends. Although we are no longer work proximity associates, the one thing that has remained constant is the strong bond we have! I am forever grateful for your presence in my life because it truly is a present! I hope you have an amazing day filled with yummy food and cake, but PLEASE come down to LA so we can celebrate!
            <br>
            Birthdays come around every year, but friends like you are once in a lifetime. Here's to another year of us laughing at our own jokes, dealing with stupid people, and keeping each other sane! Love you!♡</p>
